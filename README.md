# Learning_AVR
This branch contains notes I made while learning about architecture and programming concepts of atmeg328p.

Arduino codes is a special section where all the bare metal codes for atmega328p is written in arduino IDE.

Using arduino and flashing codes through arduino IDE,helps in retaining the arduino bootloader and also saves the headache of connecting and ISP or USB-to-TTYL convertor to flash the hex codes.

Using arduino ide also helps a lot in easy debugging as it has inbuilt serial plotter as well.

Personally, I would suggest you to use arduino for learning the basics of driver development and other realted concepts as it makes life lot easier and debugging a little less boring then it usually is.
